What kind of the 1st unit?

1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.630
This is the unit. You're learning a big picture as well as a few details.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.860
You're going to learn the basics of how the Internet works.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.300
You might even get to figure out which one of us is Nick and which one of us is filled.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.440
We hope to help you understand why the Internet is designed the way that it is. what are some of its strengths and its weaknesses?

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.670
We also teach you some of the commonly accepted network design principles.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.270
such as layering. encapsulation and packet switching.

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.420
At the end of this unit. you should be able to answer questions like. what is the Internet?

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.700
What is an Internet address? And how do applications such as the Webb Skype and bit term?

9
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.490
These principles will help you design better networks in the future.

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.330
At the end of this 1st unit. you should be familiar with something called the four layer model of the Internet.

11
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.410
It describes how the Internet is broken down into four distinct layers.

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.340
You learn what those layers are and why there are a basic principle of good network design.

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.180
You learn what the internet's four layers are and how they work together.

14
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.810
You'll learn that most applications is a transport layer called the Transmission Control Protocol. or TC. and how some applications use it.

15
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.370
He will also learn that the Internet works by breaking updating to small units cult pockets.

16
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.830
E.g.. when you request a web page. your computer sends some pockets to the web server.

17
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.320
The Internet decides how those pockets of data arrive to the right destination.

18
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.580
So this unit also examines one layer in particular in greater detail.

19
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.540
It's the You might have heard of IP the Internet protocol.

20
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.580
It's the protocol named after the Internet because it's the glue that lets the whole thing work.

21
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.670
You can change all of the other layers. but to be using the Internet. you need to be using the Internet protocol.

22
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.230
At the Network Lab. you will learn about what the Internet protocol does and how it does it.

23
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.050
You will learn about the Internet protocol addresses and how they are assigned.

24
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.030
You'll start to learn how the Internet decides the path the packet should take based on its Internet address.

25
00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:06.070
Finally. I'll show you a few software tools that you can use to inspect how your computer is using the Internet. so you can apply what you've learned in this unit the next time you browse the web.
